        <p>An embedded system can be thought of as a computer hardware
             system having software embedded in it. It can be an 
             independent system or it can be a part of a large system.
              An embedded system is a microcontroller or microprocessor 
              based system which is designed to perform a specific task.
             </p> 
             <h><b>OVERVIEW</b></h>

        <P><b>What is a System?</b> <br>
           In simple, a system is a set of interrelated parts/components
           which are designed/developed to perform a common tasks or to do
           some specific work for which it has been created. </P>

           <p><b>What does Embedded mean?</b><br>
            Embedded means including something with anything for a reason.
             Or in simple we can say something which is integrated or attached
              to another thing. Now after getting what actually system and 
              embedded mean we can easily understand what is Embedded Systems.
             </p>
             <p><b>What are Embedded Systems? </b><br>

                An Embedded System is an integrated system which is formed
                 as an combination of computer hardware and software for a 
                 specific function. It can be said as a dedicated computer
                  system which has been developed for some particular 
                  reason. But it is not our traditional computer system or
                   general-purpose computers, these are the Embedded 
                   systems which may work independently or attached to a 
                   larger system to work on few specific functions. 
                   These embedded systems can work without human
                    intervention or with little human intervention. <br>
                
               <p><b>Three main components of Embedded systems are:</b><br>
                
                1. Hardware<br><br>
                2. Software<br><br>
                3. Firmware </p>

                <p><b>Some examples of embedded systems:</b><br><br>

                Mostly Embedded systems are present everywhere. We use it 
                in our everyday life unknowingly as in most of the cases 
                it is integrated insides the larger systems. So, here are
                 some of the application areas of Embedded systems:<br>
                
               <ul>
                <li>Home appliances</li><br>
                <li>Transportation</li><br>
               <li> Health care</li><br>
               <li>Business sector & offices</li><br>
                <li>Defense sector</li><br>
                <li>Aerospace</li><br>
                <li>Agricultural Sector</li></ul>
              </ul></p>

    <b>Important Characteristics of an Embedded System:</b><br><br>
   <b> Performs specific task:</b> Embedded systems performs some specific 
    function or tasks.<br><br>
    <b>Low Cost: </b>The price of an embedded system is not so expensive.<br><br>
   <b> Time Specific:</b> It performs the tasks with in a certain time frame.<br><br>
   <b>Low Power: </b>Embedded Systems donâ€™t require much power to operate.<br><br>
   <b>High Efficiency: </b>The efficiency level of embedded systems are so high.<br><br>
    Minimal User interface: These systems require less user interface and 
    easyto use.<br><br>
   <b> Less Human intervention:</b> Embedded systems require no human intervention
     or very less human intervention.<br><br>
   <b> Highly Stable: </b>Embedded systems not change frequently mostly fixed
     maintaining stability.<br><br>
   <b> High Reliability: </b>Embedded systems are reliable they perform the tasks 
    consistently well.<br><br>
   <b> Use microprocessors or micro controllers:</b> Embedded systems use 
    microprocessors or micro controllers to design and use limited memory.<br><br>
    <b>Manufacturable:</b> The majority of embedded systems are compact and 
    affordable to manufacture. They are based on the size and low 
    complexity of the hardware<br><br>
